# TowerOfHanoi
RISC-V Assembly program for TowerOfHanoi Problem on Ripes
Processor on which the program was executed and tested on:
  32-bit Single Cycle RISC-V Processor

towerOfHanoi function takes four arguments (Num_of_Disks, <src_rod_char>, <aux_rod_char>, <dst_rod_char>)
in registers a1, a2, a3, and a4 respectively
a0 register isn't used (personal preference)
void function, doesn't return anything apart from printing on to console (also requires a function and specific function defined in the program)

Im very new, probably won't be helpful to anyone <3
